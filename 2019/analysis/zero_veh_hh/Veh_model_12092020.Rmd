## 2. Outcome Variables
The two outcome variables from these models are at the household level (by household id):  

1. Vehicle count - the number of vehicles owned (reported by survey respondents)
2. Vehicle access - the number of household vehicles owned in relation to the number of workers in each household


### a. Household Vehicle Count
Survey Responses:  
*"How many motor vehicles (in working order) are there in your household?"*
```{r Vehicle Count: Original Data}
household$vehcount_ordered <- factor(household$vehicle_count,
                                                levels=c("0 (no vehicles)","1","2","3","4","5",
                                                         "6","7","8","9","10 or more vehicles"))

table1(~vehcount_ordered, data=household, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```
\
```{r Vehicle Count: MOE}
x <- create_table_one_var_simp("vehcount_ordered",household, "household")
print(as_tibble(x), n = 12)
```

Based on survey responses, there is a very small number of households with more than 3 vehicles, so these households are grouped together.

*Number of workers by household id*
```{r Grouping vehicle count}
household <- household %>% 
  mutate(vehicle_group = case_when(vehicle_count== "0 (no vehicles)" ~ 0,
                                   vehicle_count == "1" ~ 1,
                                   vehicle_count == "2" ~ 2,
                                   TRUE ~ 3))

household$vehicle_group <- as_factor(household$vehicle_group)
table1(~vehicle_group, data=household, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```

```{r Vehicle Count regrouped: MOE}
x <- create_table_one_var_simp("vehicle_group",household, "household")
print(as_tibble(x))
```


### b. Household Vehicle Access
This variable is based on the number of household vehicles (explained above) and the number of workers within the household. 
```{r Number of household workers}
# # look at vehicle access by number of workers in a household
# unique(person_and_household$numworkers)
household$numworkers <- as_factor(household$numworkers)
table1(~numworkers, data=household, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```

```{r Number of household workers: MOE}
x <- create_table_one_var_simp("numworkers",household, "household")
print(as_tibble(x))
```
\
Based on survey responses, there is a very small number of households with more than 3 workers, so these households are grouped together
```{r Grouping household workers}
household <- household %>% 
  mutate(numworkers_group = case_when(numworkers== "0" ~ 0,
                                   numworkers == "1" ~ 1,
                                   numworkers == "2" ~ 2,
                                   TRUE ~ 3))
household$numworkers_group <- as.factor(household$numworkers_group)
table1(~numworkers_group, data=household, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```

```{r Grouping household workers: MOE}
x <- create_table_one_var_simp("numworkers_group",household, "household")
print(as_tibble(x))
```
\
**Vehicle Access is calculated by comparing the number of vehicles and the number of workers per household**

* *limited access*:  vehicles < workers
* *equal access*:  vehicles = workers
* *good access*: vehicles > workers

```{r calculating vehicle access}
# compare veh count and numworkers to get vehicle access
# convert "vehicle_group" and "numworkers_group" from factor to numeric
household$vehicle_group <- as.numeric(as.character(household$vehicle_group))
household$numworkers_group <- as.numeric(household$numworkers_group)

household <- household %>%
  mutate(hh_veh_access = case_when(vehicle_group < numworkers_group ~ 'Reduced access',
                                   vehicle_group == numworkers_group ~ 'Equal access',
                                   vehicle_group > numworkers_group ~ 'Good access'))

household$hh_veh_access <- factor(household$hh_veh_access, 
                                  levels=c("Reduced access", "Equal access","Good access"))
table1(~hh_veh_access, data=household, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```
Although vehicle access is an interesting measurement to explore, it requires a few levels of aggregation and adjustment, which could introduce error or oversimplification. Therefore, analysis will be based on household vehicle ownership, or the count of vehicles per household. 
\

## 3. Explanatory or predictor variables
There are many personal and household characteristics that can contribute to vehicle ownership at the household level. 
Based on these considerations and the data available through survey responses, the following table will attempt to match the person-level and household-level characteristics with responses provided by the survey participants. The data listed in the right column are from the in-house person (p) and household (h) views, available through Elmer, or describe an externally-sourced dataset (e).  

```{r characteristics and corresponding survey questions}
c1 <- as.data.frame(c(
  "1. Income",
  "2. Gender",
  "3. Age",
  "4. Household size",
  "5. Number of licensed (or licensed age) individuals",
  "6. Occupation",
  "7. Educational Attainment",
  "8. Number of workers",
  "9. Household lifecycle or age composition of household members",
  "10. Race or ethnicity",
  "11. Physical disabilities",
  "12. Housing type",
  "13. Housing or work location and proximity to transit",
  "14. Commuting patterns",
  "15. Quality of transit options available",
  "16. Housing proximity to services",
  "17. Environmental consciousness"))
colnames(c1)[1] <- "Vehicle-ownership Considerations"
c2 <- as.data.frame(c(
  "*hhincome_broad (p/h), hhincome_detailed (p/h)*",
  "*gender (p)*",
  "*age (p), age_category (p)*",
  "*hhsize (p/h)*",
  "*license (p)*",
  "*employment (p), jobs_count (p)*",
  "*education (p)*",
  "*numworkers (h)*",
  "*lifecycle (p/h)*",
  "*race_category (p)*",
  "*?*",
  "*rent_own (h), res_type (h)*",
  "*final_home_rgcnum (h), seattle_home (h)*",
  "*commute_freq (p), commute_mode (p), commute_dur (p), telecommute_freq (p)*",
  "*transit score by block group (e)*",
  "*displacement risk index (e)*",
  "*?*"))
colnames(c2)[1] <- "Survey Variables"

corresponding <- cbind(c1,c2)

# print table using kable()
kable(corresponding, format = "html",escape = FALSE, align = c('l','l')) %>% kable_styling("bordered",full_width = F, position = "left") #%>% column_spec(2, color = "red")#%>% column_spec(2, bold = T)
```
\
Because the outcome variable is household vehicle ownership, the person-level variables need to be aggregated to the household level. With this in mind, gender and employment type were removed from this analysis. The number of jobs per person was included.  
The table below illustrates the person-level variables related to vehicle ownership and the way in which they were aggregated:
```{r person-level characteristics and corresponding stats methods}
c1 <- as.data.frame(c(
  "Number of licensed (or licensed age) individuals",
  "Number of jobs",
  "Educational Attainment",
  "Commuting Patterns
  \n* Distance (mi) by automobile
  \n* Time (?) by automobile
  \n* Commute frequency (days/week)"))
colnames(c1)[1] <- "Person-level variables"
c2 <- as.data.frame(c(
  "sum",
  "sum",
  "min, max",
  "\nmean
  \nmean
  \nmin, max"))
colnames(c2)[1] <- "Aggregation method(s)"

corresponding <- cbind(c1,c2)

# print table using kable()
kable(corresponding, format = "html",escape = FALSE, align = c('l','l')) %>% kable_styling("bordered",full_width = F, position = "left") #%>% column_spec(2, color = "red")#%>% column_spec(2, bold = T)
```

In addition to these variables, two additional ones were calculated:  

* Number of household jobs per worker (sum of household jobs/numworkers)  
* Number of household commute trips per week (sum of household commute trips/(numworkers*5))

### a. Univariate analysis
The dependent variable or outcome will be vehicle ownership (*"vehicle_group"*: 0, 1, 2, 3+) and the independent or explanatory variables will be from the list above. Because the vehicle ownership is ordinal, an ordered logit model will be applied.

The following section will introduce descriptive statistics for each of the explanatory variables, followed by analysis. For an overview of the results from these individual analyses, please skip to section 3b.

The survey variable "hhincome_broad" is divided into 5 categories, while the survey variable "hhincome_detailed" is divided into 10 categories. Although the broader categories do not provide as much detail, the sample sizes within each category are larger and there are fewer households who chose "Prefer not to answer" (broad: 829, detailed: 1,309).

#### <span style="color:#009D6A">*2. Age/Lifecycle*</span>  
Person-level ages are likely to influence vehicle ownership, but because the variable of interest is vehicle ownership, the household age composition or household lifecycle will be evaluated.

Households were organized into four categories based on the composition and age of people in the household:  

* *Households with children:* any household with at least one member under age 18  
* *Households with younger adults:* any household without children where all adults are age 18-34  
* *Households with older adults:* any household without children where all adults are age 18-64 and at least one adult is age 35-64  
* *Households with seniors:* any household with at one adult age 65 and older

<span style="color:#20b2aa">The relationship between household lifecycle and household vehicle ownership is  statistically significant, with households with children owning more vehicles, especially those with children ages 5-17, likely because of lifestyle requirements and housing patterns.

These categories have been simplified to drivers or non-drivers. Those with a permit are considered to be drivers as they are in the pursuit of a license. Despite this recategorization, there is a large disparity between these groups, with over 10 times as many people reporting that they have a license.  
```{r license : simplified}
# table(person$license_simp)
table1(~license_simp, data=person, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```
\
The person level data of having a license is aggregated to the household level. The following values reflect the number of licenses within each surveyed household (6,319 households). 
```{r number license}
freq(person_and_household$hh_driver)
# person_and_household$hh_driver <- as.factor(person_and_household$hh_driver)
# table1(~hh_driver, data=person_and_household, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```
\
Because there are so few households with more than 4 drivers, these categories have been simplified.  
```{r number license : simplified - numeric}
person_and_household$driver_simp <- as.numeric(person_and_household$driver_simp)
freq(person_and_household$driver_simp)

#### <span style="color:#009D6A">*8. Race*</span>
The household travel survey asked participants about the race of adults in each household, with no children in households assigned to any racial group.
\
Original data at a person level (11,940 survey respondents).
```{r person-level race : stats}
# table(person_and_household$hh_race_category)
table1(~race_category, data=person, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```
\
The person level race data is aggregated to the household level (6,319) based on the following logic:  

1. Households were grouped into single racial groups alone based on the identified race of the individual members (i.e. African American alone, Asian alone, Hispanic alone, etc.), as well as a category for households with members of different races 
\
```{r hh race : stats}
# table(person_and_household$hh_race_category)
table1(~hh_race_category, data=person_and_household, render.categorical=my.render.cat)
```
\
2. Other than Asian and Non-Hispanic White, the groups were too small to report, and were therefore combined together into categories large enough to achieve statistically valid sample sizes. Survey participants could choose not to select any choice for race; households with any adults missing race were assigned to a Missing group. The "Missing/Other" group includes households categorized as "Missing" or "Other."
\

Three groups are shown in the analysis below: 

* A composite of households where all adults are African American, Hispanic, or Native American, and households with non-White adults of multiple races
* Households where all adults are Asian alone
* Households where all adults are Non-Hispanic White alone
\

\
<span style="color:#20b2aa">The relationship between race and household vehicle ownership is statistically significant for Asian households. POC households show a similar trend - owning fewer vehicles than white households - but the relationship is not significant. This is likely because of the small sample size of POC households, excluding Asian households (less than 10% of the sample: 467/6,319). This indicates that the White Only and POC household analysis is largely based on Asian households (~16%: 1,024/6,319).</span>

<span style="color:#20b2aa">Household commute frequency does not have a clear relationship with household vehicle ownership based on the aggregation techniques.
\
\
* When analyzing households by the individuals with the least frequent commute, those commuting less than once a week (not statistically significant) and those working 4 or more times a week (statistically significant, p<0.001) have fewer household vehicles than households with an individual commuting 3 or fewer days a week.
\
* When analyzing households by the individual with the most frequent commute, those commuting less than once a week have fewer household vehicles (not statistically significant)than households with an individual commuting 3 or fewer days a week. Households commuting 4 or more times a week have more household vehicles (statistically significant, p<0.1).
\
\
The reason that the households with individuals commuting less than once a week represents a very small sample of the total surveyed households (~2%, 147/6,319).</span>

\

##### <span style="color:#486CAB">*Household Commute Trips*</span>
This variable measures the number of commute trips that occur within a household by the number of commute trips that would be anticipated for the number of workers within a household. This variable was calculated by dividing the sum of household commute trips per week by the number of workers within the household multiplied by 5 (sum of household commute trips/(numworkers*5)). This value assumes that most workers commute 5 days a week.  
\
Aggregated data at a household level (6,319 survey respondents).

#### <span style="color:#009D6A">*12. Transit accessibility*</span>
Transit accessibility is measured at a census block geographic scale. These values are calculated using the transit score methodology (https://www.walkscore.com/transit-score-methodology.shtml) and are scaled by determining the log of the highest score (downtown Seattle) and the minimum score above 0. Higher values indicate greater transit accessibility.
\
Because the scores are by census block and survey respondents provided their home locations, this variable measures transit accessibility based on housing location (instead of work location). Work location is not considered in this analysis because it is at a person-level, instead of a household-level. **Future work could take the average of the transit scores associated with household members' work locations.**   
\
*For more information about the generation of the raw or scaled block group transit scores, please contact Stefan Coe.*
