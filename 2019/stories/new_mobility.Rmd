### What is new mobility? 

> "New mobility are those emerging elements of our transportation system that are enabled by digital technology, shared, driven by 
> real-time data, and often providing curb-to-curb transportation. It allows Seattleites to treat urban transportation as a customizable, 
> on-demand service. They can book and pay for different transportation services as they go, based on what they need." 
-  [Seattle Department of Transportation's New Mobility Program](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/new-mobility-program)

### The household travel survey program and new mobility

The City of Seattle and Puget Sound Regional Council conduct [household travel surveys](https://www.psrc.org/household-travel-survey-program) to understand how residents are currently using the transportation system. The travel survey collect day-to-day information from households in the central Puget Sound region about how and where we travel. The travel survey asked several questions of households about their new mobility use, including:

* How often people used ridehailing apps and carsharing
* Which trips they used ridehailing apps and carsharing for
* How often their household received packages and deliveries



### Who is using ridehailing apps, carsharing services, and home delivery services? Who is not? Is there any systematic bias in who uses these services?

Advancing race and social justice is one of Seattle's New Mobility program goals. Ideally, all residents would have equal access to the benefits of new mobility. The data below shows how usage varies across different groups...

#### Tables and analysis

Ride-hailing frequency (person-based)/Car share use/Delivery

* By Race
* By Gender
* By Income
* By education
* By Age Group
* By Auto Ownership
* By children in household

###	What areas have the highest use of ride-hailing apps, carsharing, and home delivery? Are they residents or workers of those areas? If they are non-residents, then where they coming from?

The neighborhoods with the most frequent use may need more infrastructure to support ride-hailing, carsharing, and home delivery. These neighborhoods may also need more transit service.


#### Tables and analysis

* TNC/Carshare trips by destination geography (PUMA/Urban Village or Urban Center)
* TNC/Carshare use by home location (PUMA/Urban Village or Urban Center)

### For what travel purposes are people using ride-hailing and carsharing?  When are people using ride-hailing carsharing?

-	This may indicate ways the traditional transportation system is not well meeting peopleâ€™s needs, and thus areas for improvement.

TNC trips (trip-based info)

* By time of day
* By trip purpose
* By trip distance
* By trip purpose

###  Are transit users more or less likely to use TNCs and carsharing? 
reference work with UW

* Ridehailing frequency by transit frequency

### How may ride-hailing use and carsharing correlate with future use of autonomous vehicles?

*	Ride-hailing use may correlate with future use of autonomous vehicles.  If some bias exists currently in ride-hailing, that may be perpetuated into a future system of AVs.
*	Cross-tabs  by various demographic variables

### Do people who get home deliveries travel less than similar households who do not?
This data item helps us to understand whether personal travel will decrease with more opportunities for delivery.

* Number of shopping trips by household type by home deliveries
* Are people who get delivery making fewer/more trips? Trip lengths/times/modes?

## Conclusions
