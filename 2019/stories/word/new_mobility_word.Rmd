## Introduction


What is new mobility? 

[Seattle's new mobility program](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/new-mobility-program)

What are the national trends?
What are the policy considerations for Seattle?
What are the planning implications?
Something goes here.



### Who is using ridehailing apps, carsharing services, and home delivery services? Who is not? Is there any systematic bias in who uses these services?

City of Seattle could develop policies to ensure equal access to new mobility services.  To do so, they need to understand how the technologies are currently being used.

#### Tables and analysis

Ride-hailing frequency (person-based)/Car share use/Delivery

* By Race
* By Gender
* By Income
* By education
* By Age Group
* By Auto Ownership
* By children in household

###	What areas have the highest use of ride-hailing apps, carsharing, and home delivery? Are they residents or workers of those areas? If they are non-residents, then where they coming from?

The neighborhoods with the most frequent use may need more infrastructure to support ride-hailing, carsharing, and home delivery. These neighborhoods may also need more transit service.


#### Tables and analysis

* TNC/Carshare trips by destination geography (PUMA/Urban Village or Urban Center)
* TNC/Carshare use by home location (PUMA/Urban Village or Urban Center)

### For what travel purposes are people using ride-hailing and carsharing?  When are people using ride-hailing carsharing?

-	This may indicate ways the traditional transportation system is not well meeting peopleâ€™s needs, and thus areas for improvement.

TNC trips (trip-based info)

* By time of day
* By trip purpose
* By trip distance
* By trip purpose

###  Are transit users more or less likely to use TNCs and carsharing? 
reference work with UW

* Ridehailing frequency by transit frequency

### How may ride-hailing use and carsharing correlate with future use of autonomous vehicles?

*	Ride-hailing use may correlate with future use of autonomous vehicles.  If some bias exists currently in ride-hailing, that may be perpetuated into a future system of AVs.
*	Cross-tabs  by various demographic variables

### Do people who get home deliveries travel less than similar households who do not?
This data item helps us to understand whether personal travel will decrease with more opportunities for delivery.

* Number of shopping trips by household type by home deliveries
* Are people who get delivery making fewer/more trips? Trip lengths/times/modes?

## Conclusions
