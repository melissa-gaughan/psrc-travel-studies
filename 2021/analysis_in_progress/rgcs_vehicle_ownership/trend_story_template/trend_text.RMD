# Trends in Regional Growth Centers

\begin{flushleft}
Since the early 1990s, the region has been focused on concentrating growth into centers. Regional growth centers represent a small share of the region's land that are planned for dense, walkable, mixed-used areas.

This report looks into the travel behaviors residents in RGCs and non-RGC areas.

The 2021 regional travel survey collected day-to-day information from households in the central Puget Sound region: how we traveled, where we went, how long it took - even where we chose to live and whether we got home deliveries. This report compares household travel choices in 2021, during COVID-19 conditions to that in the previous years of 2017 and 2019. Learn more at the \href{https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program}{\underline{\textcolor{blue}{PSRC household travel survey webpage}}}. You can also \href{https://household-travel-survey-psregcncl.hub.arcgis.com}{\underline{\textcolor{blue}{view the full travel survey dataset here}}}, including 2017, 2019, and 2021 data.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\begin{flushleft}
People were walking and biking more in 2021 than in previous years, but using transit less. COVID-19 conditions contributed to this substantial shift in behavior across most demographic groups. The 2023 household travel survey will show whether these patterns continue.
