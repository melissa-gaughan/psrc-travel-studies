Data is separated by survey year, with most work in 2014 onward. Directories contain various summary scripts and iPython notebooks, as well code used to clean (link) trip records. See the 'scripts' folders for stand-alone Python scripts and 'notebooks' for iPython notebooks. Any linking helper scripts and notebooks are found in the 'linking' directory. Additionally, there is a directory used for comparison different survey results, primarily between 2006 and 2014.
